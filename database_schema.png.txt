Based on the code provided, the database schema for the `FetchNextNumberAPI` can be assumed as follows:

Table Name: `your_table`

| Column Name   | Data Type | Description                           |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| CategoryCode  | VARCHAR   | The category code for the next number  |
| Value         | INT       | The current value for the category     |

This schema assumes that the `your_table` table exists in the MySQL database specified in the `DB_URL` constant. The API fetches the value based on the `CategoryCode` and updates the `Value` column with the next calculated number.

You can create the `your_table` table in your MySQL database using the following SQL statement:

```sql
CREATE TABLE your_table (
  CategoryCode VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  Value INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (CategoryCode)
);
```

Make sure to adjust the column data types and lengths according to your specific requirements.

Note: It's important to have the database schema and table created in your MySQL database before running the code. Ensure that the database connection details (URL, username, and password) in the `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` constants are correct and correspond to your database setup.
